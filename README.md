Current Work
------------
Implementing uniform destin described here:
http://wiki.opencog.org/w/DestinOpenCog

Creating enhanced visualization capabilities.

For more detailed development progress see Diary.md

Building
--------
Development has been done with Ubuntu 12.

Dependencies:
CMake ( >= 2.8 )
OpenCV 

Its been hard to pin down the exact opencv packages required for different versions of Ubuntu. Until we get this straightened out, use synaptic or the Ubuntu Software Center and do a search for opencv and install all the opencv related libs you can see. There may be around 10 different opencv libraries. 

Java Bindings: JDK, ant and SWIG 2.x

Python Bindings: python-dev (tested with python 2.7), python-opencv, and SWIG 2.x

To build DrentheDestin, CUDA SDK is required. 

Individual parts can be skipped by commenting out their ADD_SUBDIRECTORY line in the CMakeLists.txt
Some examples:

* If you dont have CUDA for example, comment out the "ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(DrentheDestin)" in Destin/CMakeLists.txt

* If you dont want to install any language bindings comment out "ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(Bindings)" in Destin/CMakeLists.txt.

* If you want python bindings but not Java, then in Destin/Bindings/CMakeLists.txt comment out "add_subdirectory(Java)"

Building:

    $ git clone http://github.com/opencog/destin.git
    $ cd destin
    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update
    $ cd Destin
    $ cmake . 
    $ make
    
Rebuilding:
    
During development sometimes CMake is not able to detect dependencies between the different built libraries. So it is recommened
to do a "make clean" and "make -j4" (j4 lets you use multiple cores) from the Destin directory to make sure everyting is building fresh.

Building Java Bindings:

The native jni bindings lib is built with CMake, the actual java program which uses it is built with java_build.sh:

    $ cd Destin/Bindings/Java
    $ ./java_build.sh
    $ ./java_run.sh
    

Show me something!
------------------

Currently the most interesting things to see are the scripts in the Destin/Bindings/Python directory. 
These scripts are meant to be used interactivly so I recommend installing and using idle for python ( search for and install the idle package).

To see a self organizing map (SOM):

Manually download http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-binary.tar.gz

    $ tar xf cifar-10-binary.tar.gz
    $ cd cifar-10-batches-bin
    $ pwd

Note the absolute path 

    $ cd Destin/Bindings/Python
    
Edit som.py and edit the cifar_dir variable near the top and change it to the absolute path of the cifar-10-batches-bin directory

    $ idle som.py

Two windows appear, select the som.py window and click Run->Run Module (F5).
Training will begin, after less than 5 minutes the SOM will popup.
    
To see DeSTIN train on an video and see its output:
    
    $ cd Destin/Bindings/Python
    $ idle dostuff.py
    
Two windows should appear.

    - select the dostuff.py window
    - click Run -> Run Modedule ( F5 )

You should see a video of a hand and windows for 8 layers.
    
In the other "*Python Shell*" window you can interact with the code after its done with 500 frames ( about a minute).
To make it continue processing type go(100) to have it process 100 more frames. You can make it train on webcam input instead by
changing the line: 

    vs = pd.VideoSource(False, "hand.m4v")
    
to 

    vs = pd.VideoSource(True, "")
